# Vamp Multipath
This was the project for the course of Computer Music.
Developed by Alessandro Ragano, Mattia Gabbrielli and me.

### Purpose
This project was built to have a portable and easy-to-use tool to visualize the result of the processing of the algorithm 
explained in the [report](Multipath_BeatTracker_report.pdf).

*Note: not all the file in the repository were used. Moreover we don't have the right to publish our professor's code, so if 
you try to download it it won't work*
